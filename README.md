# Finite Elements Framework for Fjord Ice-ocean Interactions
FEFFII is a simulation package for ice sheets-ocean dynamics in fjords, based on the Finite Elements Method and FEniCS.

## Installation
The easiest and quickest way of setting up an environment to run the code is through `conda`.
Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and use the file `feffii_env.yml` to create a virtual environment already containing all the needed packages:
`conda env create -f feffii_env.yml`

When you want to run the code, make sure the environment is activated through `conda activate feffii_env`.

You should also make sure that [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) is installed.

## Usage
Two main options:
1) The `feffii_` files in the `examples` run full simulations with some specific sets of parameters and already defined geometries. Commandline arguments can be fed in as well, run `python examples/feffii_square.py -h` (for example) for a list of arguments and documentation. Config files can also be used.
Hit CTRL-C at any time during the simulation to quit it and have the results (up to that point) plotted. The plots folder opens up automatically.
2) Run python, `import feffii` and set up a simulation interactively. The essential sequence of commands to run a scenario is:

```python
feffii.parameters.define_parameters()
mesh = feffii.mesh.create_mesh() # or your own mesh creation routine
f_spaces = feffii.functions.define_function_spaces(mesh)
f = feffii.functions.define_functions(f_spaces)
feffii.functions.init_functions(f)
domain = feffii.boundaries.Domain(mesh, f_spaces)
simulation = feffii.simulation.Simulation(f, domain)
simulation.run() # or simulation.timestep() for manual timestepping
feffii.plot.plot_solutions(f, display=True)
```

Documentation for each command is available through `help(function_name)`.

## Parameters and units of measure
Parameter defaults are stored in `.yml` files inside the `config` directory. Provide a config file either through `feffii.parameters.define_parameters()`, or as a commandline arg `--config-file FILE`. Below are the units of measures in which the model expects the physical parameters to be, which is mostly SI units. However, it is possible to automatically convert all quantities from m/s to km/h by turning on `convert_from_ms_to_kmh` - this will speed up convergence. For a full list of parameters, look into `feffii/config/default.yml`.

- `final_time`: hours; total simulation time.
- `steps_n`: integer, specifies into how many steps each of the simulation hours should be broken into (ex. `--steps-n 6` means an hour is split into 10-minutes chunks).
- `nu`: m^2/s; kinematic viscosity; expects either 1, 2 or 3 entries depending on whether different viscosity are to be used in different directions, and on whether 2D or 3D.
- `alpha`: diffusivity coefficient for temperature/salinity, m^2/s. Expects 1, 2 or 3 entries as `nu`.
- `domain_size_x`: km; domain width.
- `domain_size_y`: km; domain height.
- `mesh_resolution`: km; (average) distance between mesh nodes for unstructured mesh.

For what concerns simulation results:

- velocity: km/h
- pressure: Pascal
- temperature: Â°C
- salinity: PSU

## Storing solutions
There are multiple solutions storage options.
By default, at the end of a simulation, the following is stored in the plot path:
- `config.yml`, containing values for all the config variables.
- `solutions`, containing mesh and xml solutions for velocity, temperature, salinity, melt rate.
- png plots of solutions.

Further storage options are controlled by apt settings:
- `store_solutions`: store solutions for velocity, pressure, temperature, salinity in a XDMF file. This happens with frequency controlled by `checkpoint_interval`.
- `checkpoint_interval`: controls how often solutions are stored in XDMF file. Png plots are also produced at every checkpoint.
- `store_daily_avg`: store daily averages for velocity, temperature, salinity, melt rate. These are stored in the `daily-avg` directory, with sub-dirs named with the day number.

## Reloading solutions
Given the plot path of a previous run, it is possible to reload its setup for further processing. For this to be possible, a plot path should at minimum contain a `config.yml` file and a `solutions` directory with the mesh+solutions `xml` files inside. If daily averages were stored, those will be retrieved as well.

To reload a status, use:

`f, domain, mesh, f_spaces, daily_avg = feffii.parameters.reload_status(plot_path)`

Solutions to the 3 equations system are not stored since they can be easily recomputed using the stored solutions:
```
meltparametrization.solve_3eqs_system(f)
(m_B, T_B, S_B) = f['3eqs']['sol'].split()
```

While the reloading is mostly meant for postprocessing purposes, it is in general also possible to restart the simulation from where it stopped. However, if you used a custom geometry/mesh, you will need to recreate it yourself. The mesh can be imported, but the subdomains will not, so BCs are unlikely to be applied correctly.

## Tests and benchmarks
As of today, benchmarks include `Lid Driven Cavity`, `Buoyancy Driven Cavity`, `Rayleigh-Benard Convection` and `Ford experiment`. These have been run with different parameters (i.e. with different _difficulty_), and we check that their result does not change when the model is updated. Simulations with precision 1e-5 have been run and saved in `feffii/reference-solutions`. There are a bunch of unit tests implemented in `unit_tests.py` that check whether a newly computed solution matches the reference one.

To run a quick suite of basic benchmarks, use `python test/unit_tests.py FEFFIIBenchmarksTestsQuick` (which includes LDC nu 1e-2, BDC 100). For a more thorough set, use `python test/unit_tests.py FEFFIIBenchmarksTestsThorough` (includes all the others).

Adding a new test is simple:
1. run the simulation you'd like to include as test. Run with a high simulation precision (like `-5`) and use the `plot_path` arg to give the plots directory a meaningful name.
2. when the simulation is over, copy the plots folder in `feffii/reference-solutions`. The directory should include a `solutions` subdir and a `config.yml` file (plus a `simul_data.csv`?).
3. add a new test in `unit_tests.py`.
4. commit the new `reference-solutions` dir and `unit_tests.py` (include pngs and `simulation.log` by appending the `-f` flag to `git add`, but exclude `solutions.h5` and `solutions.xdmf`).

It would be good practice to include all test simulations in `utilities/benchmarks.sh` so that they can be re-run if needed.
